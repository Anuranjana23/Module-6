### AIM: To Create two specific classes- Beans and Mango. Along with that, create a generic function that tells us the type and color of the object we pass. Mind you, since we have passed only “obj” through it, this obj can be any object.


### ALGORITHM:
Step1: create class Beans and def a function type and color

Step 2: create a class Mango and def a function type and color

Step3: def a function func

Step 4: call the objects and execute the program

### PROGRAM:
```
class Beans ():
    def type(self):   
          print("Vegetable")
    def color(self):
          print("Green")
class Mango:
   def type(self):
          print("Fruit")
   def color(self):
         print("Yellow")
   def func(obj):
         obj.type()
         obj.color()
         obj_beans = Beans()
         obj_mango = Mango()
         func(obj_beans)
         func(obj_mango)
```
